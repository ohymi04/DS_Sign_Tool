## ðŸ”„ CHANGELOG

### v2.1.0 (2024-12)
#### Added:
- **Progress Bar Integration**:
  - Added a dynamic progress bar for signing and verifying files or directories.
  - Displays progress from 0% to 100%, providing real-time feedback on the operation's progress.
- **Process Management**:
  - Implemented functionality to track and manage active OpenSSL CLI processes.
  - Ensures that all active processes are terminated properly when the application is closed to free up system resources.
#### Fixed:
- **Process Termination**:
  - Fixed an issue where OpenSSL CLI processes could remain active if the application was closed unexpectedly.
#### Changed:
- **Standalone File Signing and Verification**:
  - Improved the `sign_file_standalone` and `verify_file_standalone` functions to use `subprocess.Popen` for process tracking.
  - Enhanced error handling with detailed feedback on CLI execution failures.

### v2.0.0 (2024-12)
#### Added:
- **Dynamic Banner**: Replaced the text-based application title with a dynamic banner that adapts to various resolutions. Now supports `.png` format for improved visual fidelity.
- **Directory Structure Hashing**: Enhanced directory signing by including tree structure validation. The `dir_file` now contains a detailed tree structure with emojis for visual clarity.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling during signing and verification for both files and directories with detailed feedback in case of failure.
#### Changed:
- **All-in-One Script**: Removed `utils.py` to consolidate all functionalities into a single Python file, simplifying deployment and maintenance.
- **File/Directory Processing**: Optimized the directory structure generation process to ensure robustness in handling nested folders and complex file hierarchies.
- **OpenSSL Encoding**: Updated OpenSSL command calls to include `encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore"` for improved compatibility across systems and environments.
#### Fixed:
- **Directory Verification**: Fixed an issue where directory verification could fail if the hash file was mismatched or modified externally.
- **Encoding Issues**: Resolved encoding errors during file reading and writing processes for `dir_file`, `hash_file`, and their respective signed counterparts.

### v1.2.0 (2024-12)
#### Added:
- **File Signing**: Sign files using a private key with the OpenSSL command line.
- **Directory Signing**: Sign directories by generating a file that lists the directory structure, calculating the hash, and signing the hash.
- **Signature Verification**: Verify the integrity of both signed files and directories by checking the structure of the directory and the validity of the hash signature.
#### Changed:
- **File/Folder Path Input**: Simplified the input process for files and folders to allow for easier browsing and selection.
- **UI Improvements**: Added a dynamic banner image to the application window for a more polished and professional appearance.
#### Fixed:
- **Signing Process**: Enhanced the signing process for directories by adding structure validation before signing.
- **Verification Process**: Improved directory verification by ensuring the structure matches the expected one before verifying the signature.

### v1.1.0 (2024-11)
#### Added:
- **File Signing**: Sign any type of file with the private key.
- **Directory Signing**: Sign directories by first compressing them into `.ZIP` files.
- **Signature Verification**: Verify the integrity and authenticity of both signed files and directories (after compression).
#### Changed:
- **Removed Directory Signing Without Compression**: Now, only compressed directories (i.e., `.ZIP` files) can be signed.
- **Interface Update**: Simplified to focus on signing and verifying files and directories (after compression) with public/private keys.
#### Fixed:
- Improved file handling and the signing process.

### v1.0.0 (2024-11)
### Added
- First version of the DS Sign Tool.
### Changed
- Improved signing performance.
### Fixed
- Minor bug fixes.
